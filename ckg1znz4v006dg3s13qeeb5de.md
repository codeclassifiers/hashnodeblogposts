## Contribute to Hacktoberfest by building 15 mini web apps

Many of us have heard about WesBos Javascript 30 day challenge for understanding the fundamentals of Javascript.
Last month I took a similar challenge to build 15 frontend applications in a month in order to learn fundamentals of react.js hooks in depth.  
The most awesome part of building these projects was I was learning a lot of things by working on mini-projects each day.
I feel that many of us would like to take on a similar challenge to improve their fundamentals of React.   
What could be a better month to pick up this challenge that Hacktoberfest itself.  
The idea is for this is pretty simple. You can find list of all this projects on my  [GitHub](https://github.com/codeclassifiers/create_react_projects)  account where each individual repository contains brief description about the problem, starter code to begin coding and a sample solution which I implemented last month.   
You can fork the repositories and start working on building your own implementations to these problems.
Once finished you can submit a pull request to my original repos with your solutions where they will be showcased side by side with everyone who is working on the same problem. 
This will help others in learning about different implementations to the same problems while you can finish the goal of making meaningful pull requests to the open-sourced projects.

Contributions can be made in three ways:  
1. You can improve the styling or logic implemented in the existing solutions.  
2. Submit your own solutions to existing problem statements for helping others.  
3. Create your problem statements and add new projects to the existing list of 15 projects.  

We start from building a college ID Card generator to building our own developer portfolio in the end.  

You can find the list of all 15 project here:  [Github Link](https://github.com/codeclassifiers/create_react_projects) 
 
Now I can totally understand that picking up some of the concepts while working on problem statements might seem like a daunting task.
