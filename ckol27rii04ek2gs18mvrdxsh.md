## Difference between block and inline elements in HTML

Hello curious stranger on the internet, you might have noticed that some HTML tags have some vertical spacing and show content on a new line while others show content on same line itself.

For example `p` tag shows text on a new line while `span` tag shows text on the same line.

The elements which start text on new line like `p` tag are called block level elements while elements like `span` which show text on same line are called as inline elements.

Let's understand some key properties of both of this types of elements:-

### Block-level Elements:
 - A block-level element always starts on a new line.
 - A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
 - A block level element has a top and a bottom margin usually.
 - Examples:-
     - `<div>`
     - `<h1>` - `<h6`
     - `<p>`

### Inline elements:
 - An inline element does not start on a new line.
 - An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
 - Examples:-
   - `<a>`
   - `<span>`
   - `<i>`
